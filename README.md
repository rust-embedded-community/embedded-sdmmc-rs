# Embedded SD/MMC [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-sdmmc.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-sdmmc) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-sdmmc/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-sdmmc)

This crate is intended to allow you to read/write files on a FAT formatted SD
card on your Rust Embedded device, as easily as using the `SdFat` Arduino
library. It is written in pure-Rust, is `#![no_std]` and does not use `alloc`
or `collections` to keep the memory footprint low. In the first instance it is
designed for readability and simplicity over performance.

## Using the crate

You will need something that implements the `BlockDevice` trait, which can read and write the 512-byte blocks (or sectors) from your card. If you were to implement this over USB Mass Storage, there's no reason this crate couldn't work with a USB Thumb Drive, but we only supply a `BlockDevice` suitable for reading SD and SDHC cards over SPI.

```rust
let mut spi_dev = embedded_sdmmc::SdMmcSpi::new(embedded_sdmmc::SdMmcSpi::new(sdmmc_spi, sdmmc_cs), time_source);
write!(uart, "Init SD card...").unwrap();
match spi_dev.acquire() {
    Ok(block) => {
        let mut cont = embedded_sdmmc::Controller::new(block, time_source);
        write!(uart, "OK!\nCard size...").unwrap();
        match cont.device().card_size_bytes() {
            Ok(size) => writeln!(uart, "{}", size).unwrap(),
            Err(e) => writeln!(uart, "Err: {:?}", e).unwrap(),
        }
        write!(uart, "Volume 0...").unwrap();
        match cont.get_volume(embedded_sdmmc::VolumeIdx(0)) {
            Ok(v) => writeln!(uart, "{:?}", v).unwrap(),
            Err(e) => writeln!(uart, "Err: {:?}", e).unwrap(),
        }
    }
    Err(e) => writeln!(uart, "{:?}!", e).unwrap(),
}
```
