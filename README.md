# Embedded SD/MMC [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-sdmmc.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-sdmmc) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-sdmmc/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-sdmmc)

This crate is intended to allow you to read/write files on a FAT formatted SD
card on your Rust Embedded device, as easily as using the `SdFat` Arduino
library. It is written in pure-Rust, is `#![no_std]` and does not use `alloc`
or `collections` to keep the memory footprint low. In the first instance it is
designed for readability and simplicity over performance.

## Using the crate

You will need something that implements the `BlockDevice` trait, which can read and write the 512-byte blocks (or sectors) from your card. If you were to implement this over USB Mass Storage, there's no reason this crate couldn't work with a USB Thumb Drive, but we only supply a `BlockDevice` suitable for reading SD and SDHC cards over SPI.

```rust
// Build an SD Card interface out of an SPI device, a chip-select pin and the delay object
let sdcard = embedded_sdmmc::SdCard::new(sdmmc_spi, delay);
// Get the card size (this also triggers card initialisation because it's not been done yet)
println!("Card size is {} bytes", sdcard.num_bytes()?);
// Now let's look for volumes (also known as partitions) on our block device.
// To do this we need a Volume Manager. It will take ownership of the block device.
let volume_mgr = embedded_sdmmc::VolumeManager::new(sdcard, time_source);
// Try and access Volume 0 (i.e. the first partition).
// The volume object holds information about the filesystem on that volume.
let volume0 = volume_mgr.open_volume(embedded_sdmmc::VolumeIdx(0))?;
println!("Volume 0: {:?}", volume0);
// Open the root directory (mutably borrows from the volume).
let root_dir = volume0.open_root_dir()?;
// Open a file called "MY_FILE.TXT" in the root directory
// This mutably borrows the directory.
let my_file = root_dir.open_file_in_dir("MY_FILE.TXT", embedded_sdmmc::Mode::ReadOnly)?;
// Print the contents of the file, assuming it's in ISO-8859-1 encoding
while !my_file.is_eof() {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 32];
    let num_read = my_file.read(&mut buffer)?;
    for b in &buffer[0..num_read] {
        print!("{}", *b as char);
    }
}
```

For writing files:
```rust
let my_other_file = root_dir.open_file_in_dir("MY_DATA.CSV", embedded_sdmmc::Mode::ReadWriteCreateOrAppend)?;
my_other_file.write(b"Timestamp,Signal,Value\n")?;
my_other_file.write(b"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z,TEMP,25.0\n")?;
my_other_file.write(b"2025-01-01T00:00:01Z,TEMP,25.1\n")?;
my_other_file.write(b"2025-01-01T00:00:02Z,TEMP,25.2\n")?;

// Don't forget to flush the file so that the directory entry is updated
my_other_file.flush()?;
```

### Open directories and files

By default the `VolumeManager` will initialize with a maximum number of `4` open directories, files and volumes. This can be customized by specifying the `MAX_DIR`, `MAX_FILES` and `MAX_VOLUMES` generic consts of the `VolumeManager`:

```rust
// Create a volume manager with a maximum of 6 open directories, 12 open files, and 4 volumes (or partitions)
let cont: VolumeManager<_, _, 6, 12, 4> = VolumeManager::new_with_limits(block, time_source);
```

## Supported features

* Open files in all supported methods from an open directory
* Open an arbitrary number of directories and files
* Read data from open files
* Write data to open files
* Close files
* Delete files
* Iterate root directory
* Iterate sub-directories
* Log over defmt or the common log interface (feature flags).

## No-std usage

This repository houses no examples for no-std usage, however you can check out the following examples:

* [Pi Pico](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal-boards/blob/main/boards/rp-pico/examples/pico_spi_sd_card.rs)
* [STM32H7XX](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32h7xx-hal/blob/master/examples/sdmmc_fat.rs)
* [atsamd(pygamer)](https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/blob/master/boards/pygamer/examples/sd_card.rs)

## Todo List (PRs welcome!)

* Create new dirs
* Delete (empty) directories
* Handle MS-DOS `/path/foo/bar.txt` style paths.
